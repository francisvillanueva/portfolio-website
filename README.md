<h1>CalicOS</h1>
<p>
CalicOS is a full-stack personal portfolio website designed to present projects, self-made pixel art, and creative works within a distinctive Y2K-inspired interface. The platform combines modern web technologies with a nostalgic Windows 98-inspired aesthetic, integrating retro UI elements with contemporary development standards.
</p>
<p>
The website was developed using React for building a dynamic, component-based frontend interface and Node.js for backend services and API handling, while incorporating a visual design inspired by Windows 98 to achieve a Y2K desktop-style user experience.
